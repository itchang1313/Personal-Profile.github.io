<UL TYPE="CIRCLE">
<LI>1  cups water
<LI>1 cup uncooked short-grain white rice
<LI>3 tablespoons rice vinegar
<LI>3 tablespoons white sugar
<LI>1 ½ teaspoons salt
<LI>4 sheets nori seaweed sheets
<LI>½ pound imitation crabmeat, flaked
<LI>½ cucumber, peeled, cut into small strips
<LI>2 tablespoons pickled ginger
</UL>

<P><I>Variations</I> 
<P>Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). </P>
<P>Bring water to a boil in a medium pot; stir in rice. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.</P>
<P>Mix rice vinegar, sugar, and salt in a small bowl. Gently stir into cooked rice in the pot and set aside.</P>
<P>Lay nori sheets on a baking sheet.</P>
<P>Heat nori in the preheated oven until warm, 1 to 2 minutes.</P>
<P>Center 1 nori sheet on a bamboo sushi mat. Use wet hands to spread a thin layer of rice on top. Arrange 1/4 of the crabmeat, avocado, cucumber, and pickled ginger over rice in a line down the center. Lift one end of the mat and roll it tightly over filling to make a complete roll. Repeat with remaining ingredients.</P>
<P>Use a wet, sharp knife to cut each roll into 4 to 6 slices.</P>
<P><I>TIPS</I> If you do not have a bamboo sushi mat, the easiest way to roll sushi is with a clean dish towel.
